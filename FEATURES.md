# Agent Distribution System - New Features

## Overview
This document outlines the new features implemented in the Agent Distribution System to support agent login, sub-agent creation, and task management.

## New Features

### 1. Agent Authentication System
- **Agent Login Page**: Agents can now log in using their email and password
- **Agent Dashboard**: Dedicated dashboard for agents showing their assigned tasks
- **JWT Token Authentication**: Secure authentication for agents with separate token management

### 2. Sub-Agent Management
- **Create Sub-Agents**: Agents can create sub-agents with the same functionality as admins
- **Sub-Agent List**: View and manage all sub-agents created by the current agent
- **Delete Sub-Agents**: Remove sub-agents when no longer needed

### 3. Task Assignment System
- **Assigned Tasks View**: Agents can see all tasks assigned to them by admins
- **Task Details**: View contact information, notes, and assignment dates
- **Task Distribution**: Agents can upload files and distribute them among their sub-agents

### 4. File Upload and Distribution
- **Agent File Upload**: Agents can upload CSV files and distribute them to their sub-agents
- **Sub-Agent Distribution**: Automatic distribution of uploaded data among sub-agents
- **Upload History**: Track all uploads and distributions

### 5. Admin Data Isolation
- **Admin-Specific Data**: Each admin now only sees their own agents and tasks
- **Empty Dashboard**: New admins see empty dashboards until they create agents
- **Data Segregation**: Complete separation of data between different admins

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes
1. **New Controllers**:
   - `agentAuthController.js` - Agent authentication
   - `subAgentController.js` - Sub-agent management

2. **New Routes**:
   - `/api/agent-auth/*` - Agent authentication routes
   - `/api/sub-agents/*` - Sub-agent management routes
   - `/api/agent-tasks/*` - Agent task routes
   - `/api/agent-upload/*` - Agent file upload routes

3. **Updated Middleware**:
   - `protectAgent` - New middleware for agent authentication
   - Enhanced `protect` middleware for admin authentication

4. **Database Schema Updates**:
   - Agent model now includes `createdBy`, `createdByModel`, and `parentAgent` fields
   - DistributedData model includes `distributedBy`, `distributedByModel`, and `distributedByEmail` fields

### Frontend Changes
1. **New Components**:
   - `AgentLogin.jsx` - Agent login page
   - `AgentDashboard.jsx` - Agent dashboard
   - `SubAgentForm.jsx` - Sub-agent creation form
   - `SubAgentList.jsx` - Sub-agent management
   - `AgentTaskList.jsx` - Task assignment view
   - `AgentFileUpload.jsx` - File upload for agents

2. **Updated Components**:
   - `Login.jsx` - Added link to agent login
   - `App.jsx` - Added agent routes and protection
   - `api.js` - Added agent-specific API calls

3. **New Routes**:

   - `/agent-dashboard` - Agent dashboard (protected)

## User Flow

### Admin Flow
1. Admin registers/logs in
2. Admin creates agents
3. Admin uploads files and distributes to agents
4. Admin views distributed data

### Agent Flow
1. Agent logs in with credentials provided by admin
2. Agent views assigned tasks from admin
3. Agent creates sub-agents
4. Agent uploads files and distributes to sub-agents
5. Agent manages sub-agents and tasks

## Security Features
- JWT token authentication for both admins and agents
- Role-based access control
- Data isolation between different admins
- Secure file upload with validation
- Password hashing for all users

## API Endpoints

### Agent Authentication
- `POST /api/agent-auth/login` - Agent login
- `GET /api/agent-auth/profile` - Get agent profile

### Sub-Agent Management
- `POST /api/sub-agents` - Create sub-agent
- `GET /api/sub-agents` - Get sub-agents
- `DELETE /api/sub-agents/:id` - Delete sub-agent

### Agent Tasks
- `GET /api/agent-tasks` - Get assigned tasks
- `GET /api/agent-tasks/distributed` - Get distributed data

### Agent File Upload
- `POST /api/agent-upload` - Upload and distribute file

## Database Schema

### Agent Model
```javascript
{
  name: String,
  email: String,
  mobile: String,
  password: String,
  createdBy: ObjectId, // Admin or Agent ID
  createdByModel: String, // 'Admin' or 'Agent'
  parentAgent: ObjectId // For sub-agents
}
```

### DistributedData Model
```javascript
{
  agentId: ObjectId,
  agentName: String,
  agentEmail: String,
  firstName: String,
  phone: String,
  notes: String,
  distributedBy: ObjectId,
  distributedByModel: String, // 'Admin' or 'Agent'
  distributedByEmail: String
}
```

## Testing
To test the new features:

1. **Start the backend server**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

2. **Start the frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test Admin Flow**:
   - Register/Login as admin
   - Create agents
   - Upload files and distribute

4. **Test Agent Flow**:
   - Login as agent (use credentials from admin-created agent)
   - View assigned tasks
   - Create sub-agents
   - Upload files and distribute to sub-agents

## Notes
- All existing functionality remains intact
- New admins will see empty dashboards until they create agents
- Agents can only see their own assigned tasks and created sub-agents
- File uploads are validated for CSV format only
- All passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt
